## Next Steps
- Monitor for any additional publications to add
- Verify all links remain functional

- Update career section if employment status changes

## Active Decisions and Considerations
1. **Publication Ordering**: Maintain chronological order with newest first
2. **Link Format**: Continue using mixed markdown/HTML for BibTeX links
3. **Citation Style**: Maintain consistent author, venue, year format
4. **File Organization**: Keep separate BibTeX files for each publication

## Important Patterns and Preferences
### Publication Entry Format
```markdown
- Title: Authors, Conference/Journal, Year ([arXiv](link), <a href="bib/filename.bib">BibTeX</a>)
```

### BibTeX File Naming
- Pattern: `okamoto{YEAR}{shortname}.bib`
- Example: `okamoto2024crepe.bib`

### Content Update Process
1. Create BibTeX file first
2. Add publication entry to index.md
3. Verify all links work
4. Maintain formatting consistency

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The site uses a simple but effective single-page design
- GitHub Pages hosting makes updates straightforward
- Consistent formatting is crucial for professional appearance
- BibTeX files provide easy citation access for academic visitors
- Mixed HTML/Markdown allows for precise link formatting while maintaining readability

## Current Status
